DESCRIPTION :



This project involves developing a basic weather application or website that provides real-time weather information for a specific location. The application is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, focusing on creating a user-friendly interface and integrating weather data.

The frontend includes a clean and responsive design where users can input a city name or allow location access to fetch current weather conditions. JavaScript is used to handle API requests, process the returned JSON data, and dynamically update the UI with temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather description, and icons representing conditions like sun, clouds, or rain.

Optionally, the app can include advanced features such as:

* Changing background images based on weather (e.g., sunny, rainy).
* Displaying 5-day or hourly forecasts.
* Adding local time and sunrise/sunset info.
* Including voice input (speech recognition) or text-to-speech for accessibility.

This project helps learners understand:

* DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.
* API integration using `fetch()`.
* Responsive design using CSS.
* Practical application of web development skills.
